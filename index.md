~ $ signal --recent

- Built and validated an algorithm to catch false-positive thermocycler results.
- Introduced real-time dashboards for traceability across automation, LIMS, and lab ops.
- Implemented variable-ratio pooling and process improvements to lift capacity by 30%.
- Combined telemetry, complaint data, and CAPA signals to prioritize reliability fixes.
:::

::: prompt-block
~ $ working-style

- Default to calm, written clarity and intentional rituals.
- Bias toward instrumentation, observability, and reversible decisions.
- Prefer small, composable tools over sprawling platforms.
- Believe in teaching as a core leadership duty.

~ $ change-log --how-to-extend

To add a section, duplicate a `prompt-block` in this file, change the first line to your new command (e.g., `~ $ writing --now`), and add Markdown below it. Tune typography, spacing, and colors in `style.css`. Adjust the header prompt or metadata in `template.html` and the YAML front matter above.
